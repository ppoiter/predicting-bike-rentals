Predicting the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour in a public bike rental scheme

In this project, we investigate a dataset that contains the hourly and daily count of bikes rented between 2011 and 2012 in the Capital bikeshare system. Various machine learning algorithms are applied (linear regression, decision trees and random forests) to generate a model that can predict the number of bike rentals.
